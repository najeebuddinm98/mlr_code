# Code for MLR-Inflation-India paper

This repository presents the code needed to replicate the "Multiple Linear Regression Model for Inflation in India" published in IEEE Xplore for the 2<sup>nd</sup> edition of the International Conference Of Emerging Technologies, 2021 held in Belgaum, India.  The paper can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9456277).

The Jupyter Notebook file titled "data_merging.ipynb" performs preprocessing and merging of the data from different sources using Python 3.7. The R Notebook titled "modelling.Rmd" does the bulk of our visualization and model training plus testing.
